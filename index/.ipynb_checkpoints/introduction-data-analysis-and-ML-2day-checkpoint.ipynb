    "The aim of this workshop is to provide you with the basic knowledge and skills needed to get started with data analysis and machine learning using Python. We will dig in the Python programming language, try relevant libraries and discuss relevant strategies. On sample data sets we will deepen our knowledge and build up our own machine learning pipeline."
